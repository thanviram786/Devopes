Physical Layer : It deals with the physical connection between devices â€” literally the hardware that sends and receives raw data (bits).

Data Link Layer (DLL) :The Data Link Layer is responsible for reliable transmission of data between two devices on the same network (local).

It takes raw bits from the Physical Layer and organizes them into frames (small chunks of data).

it devided into 2 sublayers *logical link layer and Media Access Control

Network Layer: it handles the routing and forwarding of data b/w devices that are on diff networks *example for Network layer is GPS like which helps to reach the destination
