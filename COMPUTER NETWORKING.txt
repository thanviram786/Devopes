                                                    COMPUTER NETWORKING

INTERNET:

it a network which connects multiples computers across the world.

SERVER:

it as software which provide services to the user or clients(browser)

PORTS:
 
There are 65,535 ports available in total, numbered from 0 to 65535. 

Port | Service
80 | HTTP (Web)
443 | HTTPS (Secure Web)
21 | FTP (File Transfer)
22 | SSH (Secure Shell)
25 | SMTP (Email Sending)
53 | DNS (Domain Name System) 

Well-known ports (0-1023): Standard services (HTTP, FTP, etc.)

Registered ports (1024-49151): Used by software/apps

Dynamic/private ports (49152-65535): Temporary connections

                                                   STRUCTURE OF NETWORKS

OSI MODEL:

Open System Interconnection Model

All People Seem TO Need Data Processing

Phsyical

Physical Layer : It deals with the physical connection between devices — literally the hardware that sends and receives raw data (bits).

Data Link Layer (DLL) :The Data Link Layer is responsible for reliable transmission of data between two devices on the same network (local).

It takes raw bits from the Physical Layer and organizes them into frames (small chunks of data).

it devided into 2 sublayers *logical link layer and Media Access Control

Network Layer: it handles the routing and forwarding of data b/w devices that are on diff networks *example for Network layer is GPS like which helps to reach the destination   

The Network Layer is responsible for moving data between different networks — it's where routing and IP addressing happen.

It ensures that your data packet goes from the source to the destination, even if they’re in different locations or networks.
Network Layer = GPS + Address Label + Postal Route
It makes sure your digital "letter" (packet) travels between cities (networks) and gets to the right address (IP).

Transport layer: which is the layer where data sends to end to end delivery of the data,It ensures that data is sent completely, accurately, and in the correct order.

session layer: The Session Layer is responsible for starting, maintaining, and ending communication sessions between two devices or applications.

presentation layer: where data will be compressed, translation and encryption/decryption 

Application layer:The Application Layer is where network services and apps interact directly with the user.
It doesn't create applications, but provides the interface and services needed to use the network.

                                     SUMMARY of OSI MODEL

7. Application — You interact with it (e.g., browser)
6. Presentation — Formats & secures data (e.g., encryption)
5. Session — Manages sessions/connections
4. Transport — Ensures complete, ordered delivery (e.g., TCP)
3. Network — Routing (e.g., IP address)
2. Data Link — Frames, MAC address
1. Physical — Cables, bits, signals

      PROTOCOLS

#TCP/IP 
   *HTTP
   *DHCP
   *FTP
   *SMTP for sending mail
   *pop3/IMAP for receive the mail
   *SSH
   *VNC
#TELNET
#UDP


#IP ADDRESS: An ip address is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network,
      IPv4 (Most common) it has 4.3 billion addresses ex:192.168.0.10
      IPv6 (For the future) it is hexadecimal separated by colons and it has unlimited address
#PORT: A port is like a door or gate inside your computer or server that allows data to enter or leave. it helps your computer know which application or service the data should go to

 IP address : House address
 Port number: Room number

#SOCKET: A socket is like a plug point that allows twp devices to connect and communicate over a network.

#### HTTP protocol
   Hyper Text Trasfter Protocol it is the protocol used by web browses and webserver to communicate over the internet.
  HTTP used to send request and get a response from the server.
METHOD: GET    req
        POST   send
        PUT    Update
        DELETE Delete
#### SMTP Protocol:
   Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
it is a protocol used to send emails from one server to another over the internet 
   Default port number is port 25
#### POP3: post office protocol used to receive the email. default port number is port 110
#### IMAP: Internet message access protocol. it is the protocol used to acccess and image emails stored on a mail server.
 unlike pop3,IMAP keep the emails on the server and allows you to view and maange from the multiple devices. port no 143
